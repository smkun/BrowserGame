# Faire Ground Browser Game Collection

## Overview
Browser-Game submission by Scott Kunian and Adam Brown. We opted to create a “Faire Ground” of several small games that can be played, showcasing various methods of DOM manipulation with JavaScript. Our collection includes games with "level up" content, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock Paper Scissors, and playing audio functionalities.

### Main Page
Our main page consists of 5 links, each leading to a subpage where a different game can be played:
- **LPS (Rock Paper Scissors):** `lps.html`
- **Magician:** `magician.html`
- **Memory Game:** `memory.html`
- **Guess The Number:** `number.html`
- **Tic-Tac-Toe:** `ttt.html`

### Folder Structure
- **CSS:** Contains matching CSS files for styling the HTML pages.
- **JS:** JavaScript files for game logic.
- **Fonts:** All fonts are located in a Fonts subfolder.
- **ASSETS:** Contains images and other assets for the various pages.

### Highlights
- **DOM Manipulation:** Each game demonstrates unique ways to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
- **Level Up Content:** Games like Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock Paper Scissors provide interactive and competitive gameplay.
- **Audio Integration:** Some games include audio for an enhanced user experience.
